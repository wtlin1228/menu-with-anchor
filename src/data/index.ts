JavaScript is the major driver of modern web applications since it\'s the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You\'ll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web. But using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only. React to the rescue! React is all about components - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed. Need to display a list of users in your app? It\'s as simple as creating a "User" component and outputting it as often as needed. By the end of the course, you will be able to build amazing React (single page) applications! A short refresher about the most important next-gen features is provided in the course.</p></span>',

Shaun Wassell offers a modern, full-fledged introduction to JavaScript. In particular, the viewer learns the modern syntax of JavaScript: ES6.

React enables developers to create beautiful, performant, easily maintainable websites incredibly quickly. React is currently the most popular JavaScript framework on the market and is used by a majority of companies, yet it has one of the largest gaps between the number of employers who want it and the number of developers who know it. In short, 33% of employers need React skills, but only 19% of developers say they know React.<br/><br/><i>Node.js Essentials LiveLessons</i> teaches you how to write performant back-end applications in JavaScript by leveraging the Node.js runtime. Several years ago, it wasn't possible to write JavaScript programs for the back end. JavaScript was strictly limited to running in a browser, and if a developer wanted to write back-end software, they had little choice but to learn another programming language, such as PHP. Now, that has all changed. Thanks to Node.js, which enables JavaScript to be run outside the browser, JavaScript developers can write web servers, server-side scripts, and any number of other useful back-end programs.<br/><br/><i>Full-Stack React LiveLessons</i> covers the fundamentals of full-stack development with the MERN (MongoDB Express, React, and Node.js) stack. For the full stack, developers need to make sure both the front and back end communicate well together. Toward that end, this video teaches you how everything works, what the key responsibilities of each component are, and how they flow together.

      description:
        '<span><div><p>You want increased customer satisfaction, faster development cycles, and less wasted work. Domain-driven design (DDD) combined with functional programming is the innovative combo that will get you there. In this pragmatic, down-to-earth guide, you\'ll see how applying the core principles of functional programming can result in software designs that model real-world requirements both elegantly and concisely - often more so than an object-oriented approach. Practical examples in the open-source F# functional language, and examples from familiar business domains, show you how to apply these techniques to build software that is business-focused, flexible, and high quality.</p><p>Domain-driven design is a well-established approach to designing software that ensures that domain experts and developers work together effectively to create high-quality software. This book is the first to combine DDD with techniques from statically typed functional programming. This book is perfect for newcomers to DDD or functional programming - all the techniques you need will be introduced and explained.</p><p>Model a complex domain accurately using the F# type system, creating compilable code that is also readable documentation---ensuring that the code and design never get out of sync. Encode business rules in the design so that you have "compile-time unit tests," and eliminate many potential bugs by making illegal states unrepresentable. Assemble a series of small, testable functions into a complete use case, and compose these individual scenarios into a large-scale design. Discover why the combination of functional programming and DDD leads naturally to service-oriented and hexagonal architectures. Finally, create a functional domain model that works with traditional databases, NoSQL, and event stores, and safely expose your domain via a website or API.</p><p>Solve real problems by focusing on real-world requirements for your software.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The code in this book is designed to be run interactively on Windows, Mac and Linux.You will need a recent version of F# (4.0 or greater), and the appropriate .NET runtime for your platform.Full installation instructions for all platforms at fsharp.org.</p></div></span>',

      description:
        "In traditional development environments, software is designed first and then the actual coding begins. This is especially true of object-oriented programming, for which programmers might be handed a complex object model to implement. Oftentimes, though, experienced programmers who have worked on reasonably complex projects and are closer to the actual code discover ways that an object could have been designed better. This practice, known as refactoring, introduces a new concept: adding, removing, or changing the source code for the sole purpose of making it easier to maintain. Designed for intermediate- to advanced-level developers who work on medium- to large-scale systems, this learning path guides you through the software refactoring process, from definition through to implementation. By the end of this learning path, you’ll be able to create a basic refactoring plan as well as identify potential changes. What you’ll learn—and how you can apply it How to create a basic refactoring plan Identifying potential changes to code This learning path is for you because… You're an experienced software architect or developer building medium- to large-scale enterprise applications tasked with refactoring software to take advantage of modern architectural paradigms You're in charge of a team that has been assigned to break down an enterprise monolithic system and transform it to a microservices-base model Prerequisites: None Materials or downloads needed in advance: None",

        '<span>\n    \nAwareness of design smells – indicators of common design problems – helps developers or software engineers understand mistakes made while designing, what design principles were overlooked or misapplied, and what principles need to be applied properly to address those smells through refactoring. Developers and software engineers may "know" principles and patterns, but are not aware of the "smells" that exist in their design because of wrong or mis-application of principles or patterns. These smells tend to contribute heavily to technical debt – further time owed to fix projects thought to be complete – and need to be addressed via proper refactoring.<br/><br/><i>Refactoring for Software Design Smells</i> presents 25 structural design smells, their role in identifying design issues, and potential refactoring solutions. Organized across common areas of software design, each smell is presented with diagrams and examples illustrating the poor design practices and the problems that result, creating a catalog of nuggets of readily usable information that developers or engineers can apply in their projects. The authors distill their research and experience as consultants and trainers, providing insights that have been used to improve refactoring and reduce the time and costs of managing software projects. Along the way they recount anecdotes from actual projects on which the relevant smell helped address a design issue.<ul><li>Contains a comprehensive catalog of 25 structural design smells (organized around four fundamental design principles) that contribute to technical debt in software projects</li><li>Presents a unique naming scheme for smells that helps understand the cause of a smell as well as points toward its potential refactoring</li><li>Includes illustrative examples that showcase the poor design practices underlying a smell and the problems that result</li><li>Covers pragmatic techniques for refactoring design smells to manage technical debt and to create and maintain high-quality software in practice</li><li>Presents insightful anecdotes and case studies drawn from the trenches of real-world projects</li></ul>\n\n  </span>',

Routine refactoring is an opportunity to improve the internal design of code while preserving its external behavior—an essential part of sustainable Agile development. Fortunately, most developers understand why refactoring is important; the real challenge lies in how to effect change without disruption to working code. Join expert Venkat Subramaniam to learn the why and the how of refactoring. You’ll explore this necessary process by approaching refactoring incrementally, in small steps, keeping the overall goal in sight and quickly verifying, via feedback loops, whether the change improves existing functionality. You’ll examine code examples from real-world projects and then get hands-on, refactoring existing code and measuring its quality before and after changes.',

Armed with the knowledge of these patterns, you will spend less time searching for a solution to a common problem and be familiar with the solutions developed from experience, as well as their advantages and drawbacks. The other use of design patterns is as a concise and an efficient way to communicate. A pattern is a familiar and instantly recognizable solution to specific problem; through its use, sometimes with a single line of code, we can convey a considerable amount of information. The code conveys: "This is the problem we are facing, these are additional considerations that are most important in our case; hence, the following well-known solution was chosen."\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of design patterns to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Recognize the most common design patterns used in C++\n</li><li>Understand how to use C++ generic programming to solve common design problems\n</li><li>Explore the most powerful C++ idioms, their strengths, and drawbacks\n</li><li>Rediscover how to use popular C++ idioms with generic programming\n</li><li>Understand the impact of design patterns on the program\'s performance\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for experienced C++ developers and programmers who wish to learn about software design patterns and principles and apply them to create robust, reusable, and easily maintainable apps.</p></span>',

      title: 'Craft GraphQL APIs in Elixir with Absinthe',
      description:
        "<span><p/><div><p>Your domain is rich and interconnected, and your API should be too. Upgrade your web API to GraphQL, leveraging its flexible queries to empower your users, and its declarative structure to simplify your code. Absinthe is the GraphQL toolkit for Elixir, a functional programming language designed to enable massive concurrency atop robust application architectures. Written by the creators of Absinthe, this book will help you take full advantage of these two groundbreaking technologies. Build your own flexible, high-performance APIs using step-by-step guidance and expert advice you won't find anywhere else.</p><p>GraphQL is a new way of structuring and building web services, and the result is transformational. Find out how to offer a more tailored, cohesive experience to your users, easily aggregate data from different data sources, and improve your back end's maintainability with Absinthe's declarative approach to defining how your API works.</p><p>Build a GraphQL-based API from scratch using Absinthe, starting from core principles. Learn the type system and how to expand your schema to suit your application's needs. Discover a growing ecosystem of tools and utilities to understand, debug, and document your API. Take it to production, but do it safely with solid best practices in mind. Find out how complexity analysis and persisted queries can let you support your users flexibly, but responsibly too. Along the way, discover how Elixir makes all the difference for a high performance, fault-tolerant API. Use asynchronous and batching execution, or write your own custom add-ons to extend Absinthe. Go live with subscriptions, delivering data over websockets on top of Elixir (and Erlang/OTP's) famous solid performance and real-time capabilities.</p><p>Transform your applications with the powerful combination of Elixir and GraphQL, using Absinthe.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>To follow along with the book, you should have Erlang/OTP 19+ and Elixir 1.4+ installed.

        "<span><i>This course is exactly what you need to understand and start using GraphQL.</i><br/>\nCarlos Curotto<br/><br/>\n<p><b>GraphQL in Motion</b> gets you started building GraphQL-based APIs for new and existing web and mobile applications. Featuring expert presenter Tyler Reckart and dozens of high-quality video lessons, you'll practice as you go and start using what you learn immediately.<br/>\n<b>GraphQL in Motion</b> teaches you to use GraphQL to build easy-to-manage APIs that radically simplify communication between the components and services that make up a web application. You'll begin by learning how GraphQL fits into various application architectures, including how it compares to REST and other API styles. Following a series of examples, you'll learn to use the GraphQL syntax to write simple data-retrieval queries, dig into schema design, and tackle more advanced challenges like direct data manipulation and error handling. Along the way, you'll find exercises that encourage you to practice as you go so you'll be ready to take on the real world.</p>\n<p>In applications with many moving parts, it's a monumental task to keep track of which components and services are responsible for which data at any given time. GraphQL provides an abstraction layer through which you can request data from application services without knowing their underlying architecture. Developed by Facebook to simplify their internal APIs, GraphQL is now available as an open source tool you can use for your own web and mobile applications. Just like REST, GraphQL receives queries and returns resources; however, with GraphQL you can specify the resources you want in a single query without knowing anything about the way the servers are organized. Powerful, fast, and designed with modern development in mind, GraphQL-based systems are more flexible and developer-friendly than traditional REST-based architectures. <br/>\n<br/>Inside:\n</p><ul><li>When to use GraphQL\n</li><li>Writing queries in GraphQL\n</li><li>GraphQL schemas and resolvers\n</li><li>Fetching and manipulating data\n</li><li>Debugging and error handling\n</li><li>Integrating GraphQL with existing JavaScript apps\n</li></ul>\nLearners should be familiar with full-stack web application designs, including RESTful services. Examples are in JavaScript.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Tyler Reckart</b> has been using GraphQL ever since its open-source debut in 2015. He's a software engineer at BoomTownROI, where he builds engaging experiences and tools that help real estate professionals acquire new leads and grow their businesses. \n<br/><br/>\n<i>It's a hands on bootcamp on setting up a GraphQL API. The pace is fast but you get through a lot of stuff and it rewards rewatching.</i><br/>\nStephen Oates<br/><br/>\n<i>Really useful for setting foundations of GraphQL, with practical examples.</i><br/>\nMiguel Montalvo<br/><br/>\n  </span>",
